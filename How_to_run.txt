How to run our codes?

First, make sure the python interpreter is or above 3.6.

Numpy, pandas, scikit-learn and matplotlib are required.

It is highly recommended to use Anacondaâ€™s python interpreter, which has all required packages.

Then run main.py.

If your scikit-learn is below 0.18 version, there may be an error occur. Please update scikit-learn to lateset version.
